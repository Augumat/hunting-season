# It's Hunting Season!

A Minecraft data pack that implements a fully functioning hunter(s) VS speedrunner minigame.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of the pack `hunting-season-1-0.zip` from the RELEASES tab on this page.
2. Create a new world for the match (the world folder needs to exist).
3. Place the zip file in the `datapacks` folder inside your world file.
**TODO verify so I don't look like an idiot**
4. Enable the datapack when you start the world, then follow the usage steps to get started!

## Usage

**TODO copy over the help explanation in plaintext**

You can also run the command `scrub:huntingseason/help` ingame for the same explanation given above, including nifty hover and click events for the listed commands that autofill them into your chat bar!
(The teal commands and green `[?]` boxes can be interacted with in this manner)

**TODO test this out**

A user with operator permissions should run the commands, but if for some reason you don't want to or can't give operator permissions to the person who wishes to volunteer as the runner, use the command `/execute as <name_here> run /function scrub:huntingseason/volunteer` and replace `<name_here>` with the person you want.
